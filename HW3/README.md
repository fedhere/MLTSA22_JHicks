Team Members: Jonathan Hicks, Dat Nguyen,Kopo Oromeng, Janina Boecher, Kristina Rainich

Jonathan Hicks: Developed his code independently

NOTE: the team did not find time to meet to work as a group and figure this assignment out. Only having the weekend to do the assignments has made this difficult for us.

What I learned: I learned that ARIMA models and ARMA models may not be the best predictors of financial data. They show trends slightly better than random chance, but I would not put my money on its success.
